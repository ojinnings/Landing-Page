# Landing-Page
The Odin Project: Landing page using HTML &amp; CSS

In this project I utilized flexbox to create a basic landing page. The inital design is based on Odin's example page. I was able to apply what I learned in the lessons to create containers to easily arrange my site page. I reinforced what I had learned about html and css styling. This was a great practice project to work on enhancing my coding skills!
